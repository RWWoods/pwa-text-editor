# pwa-text-editor

## Description

PWA-text-editor provides an in-browser text editor that uses a service worker and IndexedDb to save content and perform even when offline. This project also webpack to bundle the content for use in browser.

## Installation

you will need node project manager (npm) in order to the dev dependencies. Start with the root package.json, where npm install is scripted to also perform installs in the client and server packages. The "npm run start" script will use webpack to build our "dist" folder for use in browser, and will start the server in the backend.
